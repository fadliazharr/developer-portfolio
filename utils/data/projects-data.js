        description: "I fully developed a privacy-preserving e-voting system integrating homomorphic encryption for enhanced security. The system utilizes Pyfhel for encryption, Django for backend development, ReactJS for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage. It ensures secure vote transmission and tallying without decrypting individual votes. The system encrypts votes using Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), processes them securely, and decrypts the final result. Additionally, it follows privacy-preserving data-sharing principles and complies with security regulations.",
